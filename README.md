# Two-Tier Flask Notes App with MySQL

This project is a simple two-tier application that allows users to store and manage notes. It consists of a Flask-based web application and a MySQL database. The app is containerized using Docker and orchestrated using Kubernetes.

## üß± Architecture Overview

- **Frontend & Backend**: Flask application to create, read, and delete notes.
- **Database**: MySQL to persist notes data.
- **Containers**: Each component runs in its own Docker container.
- **Docker Network**: Connects Flask app and MySQL container.
- **Volumes**: Ensures MySQL data persistence using a local disk volume.
- **Kubernetes Manifests**:
  - Deployments for `notes-app` and `mysql`
  - Services to expose internal and external access
  - ConfigMaps and Secrets for configuration management
  - Namespaces for environment separation
